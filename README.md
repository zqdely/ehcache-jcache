Ehcache-JCache  For Ehcache 2.x.   
==============

**Important:** This project isn't maintained anymore as Ehcache 2.x will slowly retire. Please consider migrating to [Ehcache 3.x](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3) which has built-in JSR107 support.

About
-----

*ehcache-jcache* is a full implementation of the API and SPI from JSR-107 (aka JCache). It provides a wrapper around an Ehcache cache
that allows allows you to use Ehcache as the caching provider using only JSR-107 APIs.

More detailed information about how to use this is found under the [ehcache-jcache](https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/ehcache-jcache/tree/master/ehcache-jcache)
module

Modules
--------------------
* [ehcache-jcache](https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/ehcache-jcache/tree/master/ehcache-jcache)
  This contains the ehcache-jcache implementation
* [jcache-tck-runner](https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/ehcache-jcache/tree/master/jcache-tck-runner)
  This runs the JSR107 TCK suite against the ehcache-jcache implementation to verify compliance with the spec.


Build
--------------------
* Just run the following command line (provided you have maven 3 already installed) :

    mvn clean install


* You may want to disable the run-tck profile (if you don't have the TCK in your local maven repository since it's not published to a maven repository) :

    mvn clean install -P -run-tck

* Current build status: [![Build Status](https://ehcache.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=ehcache-jcache)](https://ehcache.ci.cloudbees.com/job/ehcache-jcache/)
